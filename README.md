# Checkout Kata

Some example solutions for Dave Thomas's (Checkout kata)[http://codekata.com/kata/kata09-back-to-the-checkout/].

These were completed using TDD to produce an iterative red-green-refactor design.

It's an interesting point that every time I do this (or any Kata), I never do it the same twice! Some solutions are better than others, but it proves there's many ways to get software working!

Includes:

    * Oct 2016 attempt - C# Solution (using .NET Framework 4.5 / NUnit) 
    * Mar 2021 attempt - C# Solution (using .NET 5 / xUnit) - an improvement I think!
